### JAAB: Multistage-Pipeline for Jotting and Assessing Actions in Boxing

## Overview

Boxing is a sport that consists of fast and explosive movement. In boxing there are a lot of actions happening sequentially and simultaneously in a short span of time. Our model is built for detecting those spontantenous action, specifically, whenever an athlete throws a punch we want to detect whether that punch land on the other athlete, miss the target, or blocked by the other athlete. Due to the niche of the task, we use our own custom dataset.

The project composes of two main folder. The folder labeled "JAABPortal" contains the website implementation for running the model as inference over the internet. The folder labeled "T-DEED_exp" contains all of the necessary component to develop and experiment with our model.

Please refer to each folder for further instruction or information
